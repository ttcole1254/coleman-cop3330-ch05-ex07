/*
* Quadratic equations are of the form
* a · x
* 2 + b · x + c = 0
* To solve these, one uses the quadratic formula:
* There is a problem, though: if b2–4ac is less than zero, then it will fail. Write a program that can calculate x for a
* quadratic equation. Create a function that prints out the roots of a quadratic equation, given a, b, c. When the program
* detects an equation with no real roots, have it print out a message. How do you know that your results are plausible? Can
* you check that they are correct?
